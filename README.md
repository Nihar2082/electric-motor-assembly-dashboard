# Electric Motor Assembly Dashboard  

This project simulates and visualizes data for an electric motor assembly line. It uses Python for data generation and analysis, and includes dashboards for visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) like assembly time, efficiency, and defect rates.  

---

## Project Overview  

The purpose of this project is to analyze production trends in an electric motor assembly line by generating and visualizing simulated data. Insights derived from this analysis can help improve production efficiency and identify bottlenecks.  

### Features:  
- Simulated electric motor production data (motor type, assembly time, defect rate, etc.)  
- Visualization of KPIs, including assembly time distribution and efficiency vs. defect rate  
- Easy-to-run scripts for data generation and analysis
